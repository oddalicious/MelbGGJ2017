Pants then socks
I want sugar in my coffee, not coffee in my sugar
A closed mouth gathers no foot
It's ok not to kill your enemies
Your identity is not secret
Use your words
A rolling stone gathers no moss
The sound of one hand clapping is annoying
A watched pot never boils
Feed the cat
Don't feed people to sharks
It's impolite to defenestrate
Try not to rob the bank
Don't stab people you don't like
Normal people are not evil
Citizens don't need to be heroic
Make your own destiny
Don't put your lunch in the chemical fridge
Underpants then pants
No dynamite in public
Leave it to the police
You don't need a nemesis to be happy
Don't write notes in blood
It's ok if people know your face
Spandex is not fashionable
Spoons are for eating with
Killer sharks are not pets
Humans are not fish food
